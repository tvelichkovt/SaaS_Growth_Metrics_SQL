# Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. 
	# The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
	# The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and can be calculated as ((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.
		# (Value This month â€“ Value Previous month) x 100 / Previous Month= Percentage Growth
